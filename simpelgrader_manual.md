1. Prerequisites
2. Installation
3. Preparing the assignments
4. Preparing the grading xml file
5. Preparing Simpelgrader.ini
6. First start

## Prerequisites

The first (and only) requirement is Python version 3.8 or higher. 

## Installation

The first step is cloning the project repo:

`git clone https://github.com/pemo11/simpelgrader`

The next step is to install the Python packages needed for this application.

I recommend creating a Virtual Environment first because the installed packages won't interfere with the packages used by other Python applications on this computer.

Start Simplegrader to check if everything is working:

`python .\Main.py`

The main (and only) menue appears (figure 1).

Choose Menue option A for checking the simpelgrader.ini settings.

None of the settings are valid at the moment. 

Choose Menue option H for showing the log file with the standard editor. There will be a entries with error messages.
