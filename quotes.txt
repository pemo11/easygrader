To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer
The only legitimate use of a computer is to play games
Make it so
Computers solves problems that have not existed before
The more you try the more you will get frustrated
Happy days are here again
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end
Queen to Queen's Level Three, Captain Kirk
Change is the essential process of all existence
Death, when unnecessary, is a tragic thing
The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination
Yeah? Well, history's gonna change
If you put your mind to it, you can do anything
If there's one thing you don't need, it's headaches
